An example of the conversion from legacy to next.

Supports:

- Title
- Paragraphs
- bold/italic/underline
- Links

I think it's a pretty straight path to add everything else although there are some things that I think should be changed in the next schema which will cause a slight shift in the data.

For example, I notice that images are done as an inline. I'd recommend switching these to blocks. It will cause a bit of pain at the outset (some people relying on inline will have their text pushed to the previous or next block), but I think this will serve you better in the long run.
